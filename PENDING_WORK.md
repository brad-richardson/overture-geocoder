# Pending Work — 2026-07-17

This is the active roadmap. Completed PR history is intentionally omitted unless
its result constrains the next decision. The implementation baseline is
`7480d57` (`main` after #85); the current remote evidence is recorded in
`benchmarks/2026-07-17-remote-address-places-r2-evidence.md`.

## Current state

- Production is healthy on data version `2026-07-13.0` and remains
  division-only. No address, Places, street, or exact-country experiment is
  discoverable from the production catalog.
- The shared range-reader, compressed address pages, compact Places shards,
  packed Places head, global address task inventory, and hash-verifying R2
  store are merged.
- Three current-release address tasks passed source accounting, exact reducer
  checks, lossless page decode checks, and the hosted runner envelope. Structured
  retention varied from 40.29% to effectively 100%; regional completeness is a
  product constraint, not a single global coefficient.
- The isolated Places Worker passed exact producer/reader equivalence through
  real R2. Packed-head cold access used four reads and 132 KB; a three-shard
  fallback used 15 logical ranges and took 1.347 seconds on its first observed
  request. Places remains disabled by default.
- The remote R2 rehearsal passed partial upload, repeated verified resume, empty
  restore, stale-local repair, and cleanup. The small rehearsal now belongs in
  path-filtered `main` smoke CI; the large external-data jobs remain manual.
- The July 25 rebuild remains the next production rebuild. The July 13 rebuild
  is recent enough that no ad-hoc production rebuild is justified by this work.

## Decisions and constraints in force

1. Do not promote experimental families until their correctness, byte, heap,
   latency, failure, and product-coverage gates pass.
2. Keep one range-readable framing family and one Worker range-reader core.
   Payload formats may differ; integrity, exact-range behavior, caching, and
   physical-read planning must not fork.
3. Keep one publication path. Before address or Places publication is automated,
   add object-level conditional publication or otherwise prove there is one
   serialized publisher.
4. Exact structured address lookup returns all duplicate/ambiguous candidates.
   It must not destructively deduplicate keys or infer a universal free-form
   grammar.
5. Places launch scope remains literal: name/brand tokens, last-token prefix,
   structured category, and explicit location/context. Broad semantic search,
   one-character CJK prefixes, and unbounded tail enumeration are unsupported.
6. External Overture and Cloudflare workflows are merge-only, manual, or
   low-frequency integration evidence. They are not required pull-request CI.
7. Keep ambiguous reverse routes on `HEAD` until an exact-country candidate
   passes correctness and byte gates after the next production rebuild.

## Next work

### 1. Route and score the Places prototype

The byte reader works; query planning and product relevance are now the blocking
work.

- Add a versioned shard catalog and route explicit query location/context to the
  relevant compact shard instead of fanning every head miss across all shards.
- Preserve the packed head as the context-free fast path, but define eligibility
  and fame evidence rather than treating frequency alone as relevance.
- Run each latency case from an independent cold namespace or explicit
  smoke-only cache bypass. Report cold and warm client time, Worker time,
  physical reads, R2/cache bytes, and failure behavior separately.
- Execute and human-score `benchmarks/places-relevance-seed.json`, including
  returned names, categories, context, distance ordering, duplicate IDs, and
  repeated-order stability. Expand labels only after inspecting those results.
- Set explicit launch and stop gates from the routed measurements. Do not enable
  `place` by default while a normal located miss still follows the observed
  three-shard/15-range path or any seed class has zero relevant top-five result.

Exit artifact: one routed Worker/relevance report with a proceed, optimize, or
stop decision.

### 2. Connect real address fragments to verified resume

The bounded producer shape is viable; the next risk is global coordination and
coverage policy.

- Feed real content-addressed map fragments and their deterministic manifests
  through the verified R2 store. Rehearse partial completion, retry, empty-local
  reduce restore, and cleanup with more than one inventoried address task.
- Collect structured-retention and output-byte summaries across the planned 127
  tasks before selecting regional partitions or claiming planet storage.
- Define the public structured endpoint: required fields, exact versus prefix
  semantics, ambiguity behavior, response limits, and the disposition of rows
  missing street or number.
- Choose the partition/catalog rule from measured fanout and bytes, then add the
  object-level publication guard required by the shared finalizer path.
- Measure Actions minutes, retry amplification, peak disk/RAM, and wall time.
  Keep partial runs undiscoverable and do not hydrate Overture on the request
  path.

Exit artifact: a multi-task, non-promoting R2 map/reduce rehearsal plus a
reviewed address coverage/partition contract.

### 3. Rehearse the scheduled production path

This remains deadline-driven operational work, not a reason to rebuild early.

- Before or with the July 25 run, dispatch the existing rebuild with
  `promote=false` to exercise build, verification, immutable release-manifest
  publication, and catalog-candidate generation without changing the catalog.
  This dry run does not exercise catalog swap, production smoke, recovery, or
  pruning because those paths are correctly gated on `promote=true`.
- After the rebuild, verify lineage-backed reverse hierarchies and re-measure the
  multi-bbox ambiguous-route share. Wrapped antimeridian bboxes and materialized
  lineage only affect a newly built fleet.
- On the scheduled promoted run, record per-family inventories, promotion and
  production-smoke checks, any rollback/recovery outcome, and retention cleanup.
  Do not add address or Places artifacts to this run.

Exit artifact: one production-operations report for the July 25 release.

### 4. Re-size exact-country work after the rebuild

No current exact-country candidate passes both correctness and the proposed
5 MiB byte gate. After the new reverse baseline exists:

- decide whether the 5 MiB hot-object gate still stands;
- independently review borders, coasts, islands, enclaves, antimeridian cases,
  synthetic `X*` codes, and political-perspective labels;
- only if justified, test a conservative interior cover with exact unsimplified
  fallback and zero route-target drift; and
- ratify heap, cold-open, and warm-p95 gates only after stored-byte and
  correctness gates pass.

## Supporting engineering backlog

These do not block the first routed Places or real-fragment address slice:

- replace long-lived R2 smoke secrets with a short-lived OIDC/broker path when
  Cloudflare support makes that practical;
- replace the hardcoded seven-type ID workflow matrix with discovery plus
  `fromJSON`;
- split ID staging, build, and metadata phases while retaining
  `id_index_protocol.py` as the shared contract;
- decide whether to populate locality reverse `wkb` correctly or remove the
  dormant column/query path;
- clean existing workflow quoting findings, then re-enable shellcheck/pyflakes
  in actionlint; and
- remove or consume unfit exact-country research outputs.

## Measured constraints to carry forward

### Address

- Full task useful-gzip pages measured 35.325 B/retained row in Mexico and
  36.495 B/retained row in the US; the smallest tail measured 29.510 B/row.
- Projection peak RSS stayed below 1.73 GB and map/reduce peak RSS below 870 MB.
  The longest measured compression pass was 692 seconds.
- Maximum exact-key fanout was 252, and every tested page variant preserved
  full candidate order and IDs.
- The complete source inventory remains 473,576,753 rows, 8,704 row groups, and
  127 planned tasks. Do not multiply it by one regional retention ratio.

### Places

- Current three-region shards measured 116.38 B/place in Boston, 169.34 in
  Tokyo, and 124.38 in Mexico City. CJK token density materially changes bytes.
- Packed-head cold access measured 863 ms client time, four R2 reads, and
  132,219 bytes. Five warm observations had a 195 ms median.
- The first three-shard fallback measured 1.347 seconds, 15 logical ranges,
  12 R2 reads plus three cache hits, and 75,042 R2 bytes. Fully warm fallbacks
  had zero R2 reads but roughly 196-224 ms median client time.
- The workflow proves reader equivalence, not relevance or an independently
  cold latency distribution.

### Producer and operations

- Initial global stop gates remain 12 hours, 12 CPU on the factory equivalent,
  48 GiB RAM, 700 GiB temporary disk, and 40 GB combined compact
  Places/address output per release.
- Immutable R2 objects require verified size, metadata, and downloaded SHA-256.
  Existence alone is never a resume signal, and a conflicting object is never
  overwritten.

## Open decisions

1. Places catalog/routing, head eligibility, relevance labels, and numeric
   read/latency gates.
2. Address endpoint, incomplete-row policy, partition sizes, catalog shape, and
   publication serialization.
3. Additive degraded/partial-result signaling shared by experimental families.
4. Reverse `wkb` disposition and post-rebuild exact-country priority.
